# Random password generator
a simple node.js random-password-generator

Step 1: Install Node.js
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Step 2: Download the Release
You can download the release from the GitHub repository. Navigate to the repository's release page (https://github.com/nemson-source/Random-password-generator/releases) and download the release file (open-random-password-generator.zip) for your operating system.

Step 3: Extract the Release
Extract the downloaded release file to a directory of your choice. This will create a folder containing the necessary files for the random password generator.

Step 4: Install Required Libraries
Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you extracted the release files. Run the following commands to install the required libraries:
``
npm install crypto
npm install fs
npm install child_process
npm install readline
``
These commands will install the necessary Node.js libraries (crypto, fs, child_process, and readline) that the random password generator relies on.

Step 5: Run the Generator
After installing the required libraries, you can run the random password generator by executing the generator.bat file in the release folder. This will start the Node.js program and prompt you to enter the desired length of the random password.
